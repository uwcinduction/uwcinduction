			<h2>UWC Atlantic College expectations:<br />Why you are here!</h2>
		</header>
		<section>
			<header><h5>Learning through residential life</h5></header>
			<p>At UWC Atlantic College you will live in a dormitory with 3 other students from different countries to you. They may have different routines and there may be aspects of residential life that you are unfamiliar with.</p>
			<p>You will be expected individually and with other members of the community to live by the values upon which the College is founded, respect, responsibility and tolerance.</p>
			<p>Thinking about how you interact with others and taking responsibility within the community to contribute joyfully, respectfully and kindly.</p>
			<p>Just like at home, there are tasks that need to be completed by everyone in the house; duty dorm for example where you work with your dorm mates as a team to clean the dayroom and kitchen of your student house. You are expected to participate fully in these tasks as then we take ownership collectively of the spaces we occupy together.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<header><h5>Learning to care for yourself and others</h5></header>
			<p>Being conscious of your wellbeing and of the community around you can be challenging. For many of you, this is the first time you will have lived away from home and being totally responsible for yourself can sometimes be difficult.</p>
			<p>You will need to ensure you get enough sleep, regular physical exercise, eat well, take time for reflection and to recognise the signs in yourself of when you are not doing these. Without taking care of yourself, looking out for your friends and meeting the challenges of a UWC programme becomes difficult.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<header><h5>Intercultural and Interpersonal Awareness</h5></header>
			<p>Learning more about other people is one of the main reasons you chose to come to a UWC and one of the most important ways for you to maintain and build the community is by listening carefully to others. Empathy can be learnt and being able to see situations from someone else’s perspective is a skill that will enable you to live your life by the values and mission of the UWC movement.</p>

			<h5>Want to organise an event?</h5>
			<p>You are actively encouraged as a student of AC to take initiative and create an event that can add to the patchwork of diversity that is AC. It can be a musical event, a mini conference, a debate, whatever you would like to bring to the community to enjoy and learn about.</p>
			<p>It can be hard work to do this but very rewarding and the learning that you will gain from doing it will be very beneficial for your future! It is a responsibility that must be discussed with the Vice Principal, Pastoral who will work with you on the date of the event and the logistics – good luck!</p>

			<h5>Dining hall Guidelines</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Put the chairs under the table when you’re done eating and don’t lean back – Jeannette is very protective of her chairs.</li>
				<li>Clear your trays.</li>
				<li>Shoes are required.</li>
				<li>Don’t wear pajamas, wetsuits or muddy boots.</li>
				<li>Be nice to the staff.</li>
				<li>Don’t waste food – take only as much as you think you can eat. If you’re still hungry after finishing your plate, wait for seconds (weekdays at 6:20)</li>
				<li>Get the house supplies from the kitchen!</li>
				<li>It's vital that you eat well here. Even if you're not a good fan of the canteen food, go to meals and make sure you stay healthy.</li>
				<li>Eat lots of fruits and vegetables so you don’t get sick.</li>
				<li>If you don’t want to wake up early for breakfast, buy some cereals, yogurt, breakfast bars, etc… to keep you going. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day!</li>

		<header class="w3-container w3-xlarge">
			<h2>Student Support</h2>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>There are many ways of accessing support at AC; your personal choices like your friends and family, your dorm mates and cultural groups and more structured ways like your houseparent, the resident assistants, the school counsellor and the wellbeing programme.</p>

			<h5>Your new friends</h5>
			<p>The people you share your dorm with, your buddy dorm, your fellow students in your house, your cultural group, your friends.</p>

			<h5>Peer Listeners</h5>
			<p>The Peer Listeners are Second Year students who have had specific training in listening skills. They are particularly trustworthy, non-judgemental, sympathetic and tactful. Staff do, however, feel that issues of an extremely serious nature (such as rape, physical violence, drug abuse, pregnancy, eating disorders, suicidal thoughts or significant self-harm) are not appropriate to be dealt with by Peer Listeners. If Peer Listeners do encounter such cases, we have asked them to pass them on to a Houseparent, the Counsellor or a Nurse. With the exception of such cases, Peer Listeners will always maintain confidentiality.</p>

			<h5>Wellbeing @ AC Group</h5>
			<p>The wellbeing reps provide an informal platform for running wellbeing events at AC. They also work to raise awareness about mental health and organise events, open spaces, etc. for students to explore these issues. Although, there are scheduled events, the group is always open for anyone to attend. You can join in the events, talks, open spaces or find them in your house for any questions, suggestions, opinions and conversations.</p>

		<h5>Houseparent / Assistant Houseparent</h5>
			<p>Your houseparent lives in house next to the student house with their family and will become a very important part of your AC experience. You will have individual meetings with them throughout the year and also plenty of occasions when you gather together for house events. They are all trained to guide you through your experience and are available during the evenings when you are not in school. They will also make sure the house is run efficiently, any discipline issues are dealt with and to listen; many of them have counselling skills and all are experienced in the care of young people living away from home for the first time.</p>

		<h5>Tutors</h5>
			<p>You are all allocated a Personal Tutor and their main responsibility is to establish a relationship with you which will create an atmosphere of trust in which you feel free to approach them should you have problems, of an academic or general nature. The need for confidentiality is thus essential. They can live on or off site and there are regular times in the week when you will see them and you can also contact them via email to arrange times to see them individually.</p>

		<h5>Night staff</h5>
			<p>There are usually two Night Staff who work from 22:00 through the night until 05:30. They provide a point of contact during the night for students who are distressed or unwell. They will also make you go to bed and make sure the campus is safe and secure. They are also trained to listen to you if you have any issues. You can contact them by calling 2222.</p>

		<h5>Director of Boarding</h5>
			<p>Sarah oversees all aspects of residential life and is the first point of contact for any student queries, after your Houseparent. She is Sunley Houseparent and can be contacted via email or 1038 / 1107.</p>

		<h5>Resident Assistants</h5>
			<p>Young people employed by AC to support students in any way they can! They have usually undertaken a higher level study course, travelled and are always committed to helping you!</p>

		<h5>Vice Principal (Pastoral)</h5>
			<p>Nick Lush has overall responsibility of the pastoral care of UWC Atlantic College students and can be found in his office in the castle, calling 1003 or via email.</p>

		<h5>Health Centre Staff</h5>
			<p>Maria Cantwell and Alison Roberts are both registered nurses who are your first point of contact if you feel unwell, they are located in the Health Centre. Kay Macciochi is the Health Care Assistant who supports the nurses.</p>

		<h5>College Counsellor</h5>
			<p>Jane Wyatt is our counsellor and works from the Health Centre on Monday, Tuesday and Fridays. You can make an appointment to see her via the nurses or by emailing her directly.</p>

		<h5>Link Families</h5>
			<p>Link Families are local families from outside the college who befriend students. Being detached from the college, they will often have a different perspective on a problem, as well as providing a place of respite.</p>

		<h5>Independent Listeners</h5>
			<p>Bob and Sheila Smith live in Llantwit Major and their own children went to a UWC. Bob is a former Governor of Atlantic College and has taught in various schools and universities. Both are old friends of the college and can offer a ‘sympathetic ear’ for students who would prefer not to confide in any staff or students at the college. They can be contacted by phone (01446 792797) or e-mail (spitzkop@tiscali.co.uk).</p>

			<h2>Your Health</h2>
		</header>
		<section>
			<h5>Physical and mental health</h5>
			<p>Are equally important and at Atlantic College, there are many ways to look after both. The Moondance Hall has a large activity hall, a dance studio and a gym. After an induction, you are able to use these facilities and also to participate in the activities and classes held there. Please check your house noticeboards for detailed information.</p>
			<p>Our Health Centre, based in Kemps Covert, has two full time nurses, a Health assistant and a school counsellor. In the UK, all physical and mental health issues are in the first instance discussed with a GP (general practitioner doctor) who comes to the college twice a week. If they feel that you need to see a specialist, they will refer you to a consultant in whatever area you need.</p>
			<p>The National Health Service provides this to all residents of the UK free of charge so sometimes there is a waiting list for some services. If there is an emergency you will be taken to the Accident and Emergency department of the hospital in the nearest town (Bridgend).</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h5>Counselling</h5>
			<p>In the UK, talking therapy is the recommended route in the first instance for a mental health issue. If the GP doctor and the counsellor feel that you need further support, you will be referred to the Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) where you will see a psychiatrist and perhaps offered other therapies and / or medication. Very few students have to be referred and the support that they need can usually be found within the college structures already in place.</p>
			<p>Jane, our counsellor is very accessible and offers the following:</p>

			<h5>Learning to live responsibly</h5>
			<p>All aspects of life at AC are guided by a simple principle; consideration for others.</p>
			<p>To ensure that Atlantic College is a safe, healthy and respectful place to live for the whole community, not just students but also support staff and staff and their families that live on campus and to follow the law of the UK, all members of the community are required to abide by the following code bot in spirit and action at all times.</p>

			<h5>EDW, or Excessive Display of Wealth</h5>
			<p>You will hear this expression at AC a lot! Socio economic diversity is one of our many aspects of diversity at AC and some students come from families that are financially wealthy and others have limited or no financial resources. We know extremes exist but we wish to minimise their impact on student life. Kurt Hahn said “living with reasonable self denial” and as there is plenty of inequality in the world, we do not wish to emphasise it at AC. We ask you to not act in such a way that could be seen as EDW and to live simply and frugally.</p>
			<p>At some point in your life, these budgeting skills will prove very useful!</p>

		<section>
			<p>Nick Lush will send out the Duty Cover Rota. If there’s an emergency or you need to open a locked room, do one of these:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Go to your house notice board or your email for the Duty Cover Rota</li>
				<li>If it is a house issue, find the person in charge of your house at that time</li>
				<li>If it is a school issue, (locked department etc…) contact Duty Houseparent or Duty Administrator</li>
				<li>If it is a medical issue and the health center is open, contact the health center.</li>
				<li>If it is at night, contact the night staff by dialing 2222 on the house phone HOW TO USE THE DORM PHONE</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Most phone numbers on the phone lists have 4 digits.
			Internal calls: put in the 4 digits
			External calls: (takeaways, taxis, etc…) dial 9 then the number.
			Emergency calls: 9 999 calls the ambulance
			Calling school numbers on a mobile phone:
			Add 01446 799, then the last three numbers of the 4 digit number</p>

			<p>Your dorm has a 4 digit phone number “wxyz.” Your parents can call your dorm phone by entering: <strong>+44 01446 799 xyz</strong></p>
			<p>*If you cannot reach the night staff, call the radio phone. Dial 1313 on a college phone. You will hear this message: “You have reached the Dispatch center. To connect to a dispatcher press zero. To connect to a subscriber radio, enter radio number and hash.” Dial 101# or 102#. Remember that on a radio device, you cannot speak at the same time as the other person.</p>

			<h2>Other useful information</h2>
		</header>
		<section>
			<h5>Emails and Facebook</h5>
			<p>I know, probably the only people that use email and facebook back home are your parents. However, AC runs on these platforms. Important info and announcements from the staff/school are sent out via email. Important info and announcements from your fellow students (ex: council announcements, SLAACC events, etc…) are announced either/both on facebook and via email. Furthermore, as many students don’t have phone service, Facebook messenger is the primary means of peer-to-peer communication.<br/><strong>CHECK BOTH PLATFORMS MULTIPLE TIMES EACH DAY.</strong></p>
			<p>Delete any emails that you don’t need anymore, as the mailbox reaches its capacity very quickly. Once you’ve deleted an email, you need to ‘empty trash’ to clear the data from your mailbox.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h5>Things to Remember…</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>The sea:</strong> if the tide is high or the waves are strong, stay far away from the slipway. People die every year in this area due to the tide.</li>
				<li>Rocks and pieces of <strong>the cliffs</strong> periodically fall.</li>
				<li>If you’re on <strong>the beach</strong>, stay far away from the cliff edges so you aren’t crushed. If you’re walking along the coastal path, stay far from the edge so it doesn’t crumble under you.</li>
				<li><strong>The watchtower</strong> is out of bounds because it is an unstable structure.</li>
				<li>Please <strong>do not litter</strong> in general: this includes food waste, cigarette butts, wrappers, papers, etc…</li>
				<li><strong>The flagstones</strong> outside the castle and the arts center are extremely slippery when wet. Don’t fall on your butt!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The most important thing to remember is that your second years are ALWAYS here for you. It doesn’t matter if we’re in the same house or service or national group, whether we talk every day or not at all – we’re all UWC students here, and in the end we stick together. So if you need something, just ask. J</p>
